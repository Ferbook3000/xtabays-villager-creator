Villager Creator Stick
Put all the items you want your villager to trade in a chest in this order, from left to right: 1st buy item, 2nd buy item, sell item. This means every 3 slots are used for a single trade row, up to a maximum of 9 trades per chest. Every trade must have this structure: [Required Item] [Required Item](optional) [Offered Item], if they don't have this structure, the items will be ignored and the trade won't be added.
Once you're done filling a chest with this structure, right click it with a Villager Creator Stick and the villager will be created.
All villagers created by Villager Creator have 40 heart containers, are leatherworkers and snow villagers by default. They're also riding a block display so they can't move or be moved.

Add Trade Stick
Put a chest next to a villager created with the Villager Creator datapack and repeat the same process as with the Villager Creator Stick but using the Add Trade Stick this time. Once done, all the trades in the chest will be added to the nearest villager and the chest will be deleted.
